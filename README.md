# Snort IDS Project

This repository contains configurations and scripts for setting up and managing a Snort Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with monitoring and alerting capabilities using Prometheus and Alertmanager.

## Project Structure

- **etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml**
  - Configuration file for Alertmanager, responsible for managing alerts generated by Prometheus.

- **etc/prometheus/alerting_rule.yml**
  - Custom alerting rules for Prometheus, defining conditions that trigger alerts.

- **etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml**
  - Main configuration file for Prometheus, detailing scrape jobs and monitoring targets.

- **etc/python3/snap_debug.py**
  - A Python script for debugging purposes, potentially related to the Snap package or system state.

- **etc/python3/snort_exporter.py**
  - A Python script that likely serves as an exporter to bridge Snort data to Prometheus.

- **etc/snort/snort.lua**
  - The primary configuration file for Snort, written in Lua.

- **etc/snort/rules/custom.rules**
  - Custom Snort detection rules for identifying specific network behaviors or threats.

## Requirements

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd snort-ids-main
   ```

2. Configure Snort:
   - Modify `etc/snort/snort.lua` as needed to suit your network environment.
   - Add or update rules in `etc/snort/rules/custom.rules`.

3. Configure Prometheus:
   - Update `etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml` with scrape job targets.
   - Add custom rules to `etc/prometheus/alerting_rule.yml`.

4. Configure Alertmanager:
   - Customize `etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml` for alert routing.

5. Run Python Scripts:
   - Use `snort_exporter.py` to bridge Snort data to Prometheus.
   - Use `snap_debug.py` for debugging purposes.

6. Start Services:
   - Start Snort, Prometheus, and Alertmanager.

## Usage

- **Monitoring**: Access the Prometheus web UI at `http://<prometheus-server>:9090`.
- **Alerting**: Configure Alertmanager to send alerts to desired channels (email, Slack, etc.).
- **Logs**: Check Snort logs for intrusion detection insights.
